Hi, I'm Sarah, but I use a weird anagram name on most websites because I'm a paranoid freak :P
As a result of that, I don't really want to say where I'm from, but "Canada" is probably vague enough.
I like science, designing 3d models and textures, writing code to tinker with graphical things, reading and playing video games.
I dislike smalltalk, conspiracy theories and cruel people.
